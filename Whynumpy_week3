1) why Numpy ?
    a)Numpy offers a number of key features for scientific computing.The key feature of Numpy is support for multi-dimensional arrays.
    b)One of the trickier things to manage when working with matrices and vectors is making sure their dimensions align properly.
      Numpy actually takes a lot of that work out of the process by supporting something called broadcasting
      which makes the process easier and the code easier to read.
    c)Bascically The first reason we use Numpy is because it's fast.In fact, using Numpy's arrays can be 10 times faster than 
      Python's lists.To enable the speed,Numpy arrays are fixed in size unlike lists which can change in size.
      In elements and Numpy arrays must all be the same type.All ints or floats where as lists can hold any type.
      By restricting ndarrays in this way,it makes ndarrays both much more space efficient than lists, 
      but also opens up a range of memory and computational optimizations.
    d)The second reason we use Numpy is because of its functionality.
      Eg: Want to get the average of a vector I the matrix?
          You got it.
          Want to multiply matrices?
          You got it.
          Want to select a subset of the matrix based on indexes or values?
          You got it.
          Even when we move into Pandas, you'll be finding yourself using many of these functions.
    e)Lastly, we love Numpy because many of our favorite packages in Python rely on Numpy.In fact, Pandas which we'll be doing soon
      are built on top of Numpy.I should note that while Pandas provides higher level functionality than Numpy,
      you'll still be using Numpy as functionality at times.
