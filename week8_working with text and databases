The primary data structure for a relational model is a table,
Notice that a table structure in a DB is very similar to a Python DataFrame.
==>DataFrames can be used to load relational tables(DB tables)
   which are also called relations.
This DB table actually represents a set of tuples(rows).
We were informally calling this a record before
but now we call it a tuple.
Therefore:Table is called as relation.
          Row/record is called as Tuple.
Remember the definition of sets,
it's a collection of distinct elements
of the same type.(remember the word 'distinct' and 'Same type')          
In general many systems/DB's will allow duplicate tuples in their relations(tables)
but mechanisms are provided to prevent duplicate entries.

Note:It is important to understand that join
is one of the most expensive,
that is time and space consuming, operations.
As data becomes larger
and the tables contains hundreds of millions of tuples,
the join operation can easily become a bottleneck
in a larger analytical application.
So, for data science
that involves big data,when we need joins,
it's very important to choose
a suitable data management platform
that makes its operation efficient.
