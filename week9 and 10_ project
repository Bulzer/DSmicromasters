Remember that the science component in data science is the creation of a
hypothesis based on exploration and testing of that hypothesis through analysis. 
You may need to go through many of these steps multiple times before you arrive at meaningful hypothesis or conclusions.

Week 9:
Step 1:  Find a dataset or datasets
Based on your interest, identify a dataset which you will want to examine.  
There is a reading this week on where you can find open datasets, 
but feel free to use other datasets you have access to and care publicly share results about. 
Or, feel free to create your own dataset by getting data from the web using tools you learned in Week 8.

 

This step may take some time, as you’ll likely look at a number of datasets before you find one (or more) which holds promising data for the kinds of questions you want to ask.  Feel free to use a combination of datasets which you can merge in some meaningful way.

Step 2:  Explore the dataset(s)
In this step, you should explore what is present in the data and how the data is organized.  If using multiple datasets, you’ll need to determine what common features allow you to merge the datasets.  You’ll want to answer the following questions:
Are there quality issues in the dataset (noisy, missing data, etc.)?
What will you need to do to clean and/or transform the raw data for analysis?

Step 3:  Identify 1-3 research questions:
Now that you have a better understanding of the data, you will want to form a research question which is interesting to you.
The research question should be broad enough to be of interest to a reader but narrow enough that the question can be answered 
with the data.  Some examples:

1)Too Narrow:  What is the GDP of the U.S. for 2011?  This is just asking for a fact or a single data point.  
2)Too Broad:  What is the primary reason for global poverty?  This could be a Ph.D. thesis and would still be way too broad.
  What data will you use to answer this question?  Even if a single dataset offered an answer, would it be defendable given
  the variety of datasets out there?
3)Good:  Can you use sentiment analysis on comments about movies on Twitter to predict its box office earnings?  
  If you have, or can obtain, tweets which refer to a variety of movies and you have their box office earnings, 
  this is a question which you can potentially answer well. 
--------------------------------------
Step 4:  Describe your dataset(s) and your research question(s) at the end of Week 9 in the Project Checkpoint. 

Week 10:
Step 5:  Identify your research methods
Based on your research question, you can now describe how you will go about answering that question.  Your methods will depend on the question being asked.  For example, if you are looking for a relationship between two items (say, CO2 emissions and GDP), you may wish to use scatter plots and statistical correlation.  If you are trying to predict an outcome based on input data, you’ll need to identify the appropriate methods from the week on Machine Learning.  Be sure to document, in your notebook, your research methods.

Step 6:  Present your findings
In this step, you can begin to report your findings.  What did you learn from the data and how do your findings help answer your research question?  Use visualizations to present these findings.

Step 7:  Identify limitations to your conclusions
Rarely will a single data analysis conclusively answer a research question.  Here, you need to identify possible limitations.  For example, are your results limited to a certain area, city, or country?  Are you making assumptions about the data which may, or may not, be valid (e.g., that students in one term are equally qualified as students in another)?  Document these limitations.

Guidelines:
Write for a diverse audience including:

General public: Reads only the title and abstract looking for high-level point mainly for conversational purposes.

A company CEO: Reads introduction, research question, findings and conclusions looking for business value and details related to that.

An academic advisor (or company CTO): Reads the full presentation AND your Jupyter Notebook paying particular attention to technical coherence, academic value, and technical data science strengths.

Where to find datasets?
There are a surprising number of open datasets on the web.
1)UCI's Machine Learning Repository - UC Irvine maintains a fantastic collection of datasets for machine learning, tagged by machine learning task (among other things).  If you want to try out the ideas from Week 7, this is the place to start.
Links:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html

2)Kaggle - Online collection of datasets.  Kaggle also has competitions for data mining and information about jobs in data science.
Links:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
3)KDnuggets Dataset - Another collection of datasets - most of the datasets are free. Within KDnuggets, 
there are links for government data,  Data APIs,  and Data Mining Competitions.

Astrophysics Example:

A collaborate group of scientists
analyzed satellite imagery of the cosmic microwave background
to study the beginning of the universe.
The notebook uses Python libraries
familiar to you from this course.
However, it also includes
domain-specific references in cosmology.
This is a typical situation for data science
where domain-specific skills get combined
with data science skills.
The example has three distinct sections
using advanced functionalities of pandas,
NumPy, and Matplotlib.

In section one,
we will read a map created by the Planck satellite
and explore a scientific data format called HDF5.
In section two,
the notebook will use NumPy
to create a simulation of how Planck scans the sky
throughout the year of observations,
and we will plot scanning rings
in different reference frames.
In section three,
the notebook will use the scanning coordinates
created in section two
to simulate an observation of the map used in section one.

**Protein Database Example:
---------------------------
Protein Data Bank Analysis.
The notebook was developed by David Dorner,
one of our top students.
This notebook provides a great example
of using structured scientific data through an API
and visualizing it.
PDB is a large repository of semi-curated,
crowdsourced protein structure data.
The notebook uses PDB's RESTful Web Service
to access the data available in PDB
and uses the Boquet library to visualize the data.
Although most of you are not biologists,
we hope that you'll explore the notebook
for possible ideas you might wanna use in your project.

How your project will be assessed ?
The Rubric others will use to assess your project (and what you'll use to assess other projects) is based primarily on the slides you'll submit.  It is worth reviewing this to know how you will be assessed before starting your work and while preparing your presentation slides.

Rubric:
<Abstract Slide> How well did the abstract describe the project?
3 - Very well.  It described the dataset, research question, methods, and findings well.
2 - Well.  Three of the four elements (dataset, research question, methods, and findings) were explained well, one was not.
1 - Fairly well.  One or two of the four elements (dataset, research question, methods, and findings) were explained, however two or more of the above items is missing.
0 - Absent.  No abstract provided.

<Abstract Slide> Was the abstract concise and clear?

<Research Question(s) Slide>  How appropriate was the research question for the data?
2 - Appropriate.  They provided a research question which was appropriate given the data in the dataset.
1 - Too Narrow.  They provided a research question, however it felt too narrow for a full data-analysis (e.g., it asks for a single datapoint, not an analysis of the data).
1 - Too Broad .  They provided a research question, however it felt too broad given this dataset (e.g., it asks to reach a sweeping conclusion which is too broad for one dataset).
0 - Absent.  No research question provided.
 
<Method Slide> How well were the research methods articulated?
2 - Well. It was clear from their methods how they were analyzing the data.
1 - Fairly well. Methods were provided but it was not clear how they were being used and for what data.
0 - Absent.  No methods provided.
 
<Method Slide> How appropriate were the research methods used?
3 - Unsure. If you are unsure or don’t feel qualified to assess the research methods, please select this option.
3 - Very appropriate.  These are reasonable research methods to answer the research question (e.g., the author is using regression to predict a numeric value).  
2 - Possibly Appropriate.  The methods described may not be ideal for this approach or the methods are not described well enough to tell.
