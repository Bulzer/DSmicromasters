Machine learning: is a field of study that focuses on computer systems that can learn from data.
That is, these systems, often called models,can learn to perform a specific task
by analyzing lots of examples for a particular problem.

Eg:identify a cat after analysisng lots of image of cats
The Machine Learning algorithm is programmed to learn from the data that 
there's nothing in the algorithm or program which directly aims to learn the given task.
** i.e Machine Learning models are not given the step by step instructions on how to recognize
the image of a cat.Instead, the model learns on its own what features
are important in determining that a picture contains a cat from the data that it has analyzed.

*Because the model learns to perform this task from data,it's good to note that the amount and quality of data
available for building the model are important factors in how well the model learns from the task.

Therefore,Machine Learning models learn from data to perform a task
without being explicitly programmed.

Clasification:
In classification,the goal is to predict the category of the input data.
The categories to be predicted are called classifications.
Eg:predicting the weather as being sunny,rainy, windy or cloudy.
If the predicted output is b/w 2 values ==> it is called binary Classification.

Regression:
When your model has to predict a numeric value instead of a category,
then the task becomes a regression problem.
Eg:predict the price of a stock.
The stock price is a numeric value,not a category, so this is a regression task.
If you were to predict whether the stock price will rise or fall,then that would 
be a classification problem but if you're predicting the actual price of the stock,
then that's a regression problem.

To summarize,in classification you're predicting a category,
and in regression,you're predicting a numeric value.

Clustering:
In cluster analysis,the goal is to organize similar items in your dataset into groups.
