1)Why Jupyter?
    The data science process, in most the steps we learned about earlier in the course.Jupyter Notebooks allow us to document that process by combining notes, code, and graphics.
    Most importantly, combining these features allows others to read the notebooks and understand the motives behind each step and why decisions were made.
    If someone else wants to examine your results or build on your findings,they can see exactly how you conducted the research.
    Jupyter Notebooks don't just contain your notes and process;they contain your results as well.
    And lastly, as we mentioned before,Jupyter supports Julia, Python, R,three of the most popular programming languages for conducting data science today,along with other languages.

2)Getting started with Jupyter
    The first page is called the Dashboard.It basically lists the contents of the folder you launched Jupyter notebook from.
    If you don't use the local host as the server in your laptop locally, i.e we can run the juyter in another machine also.
    steps:
    1)open Jupyter notebook using anaconda prompt command:'jupyter notebook'
    2)Jupyter terminal will be opened in the browser.
    3) create a New notebook and select Python 3
    4)Now we have a new notebook,click on Untitled on top to name it(Intro Notebook).
     (now if we go back to our dashboard ==>we can see our notebook created with name Intro Notebook.ipynb)
     (In the beginning, there's sometimes some confusion as both the notebook application and the notebook are called notebook,
       but they are separate.The notebook application, is a web application that creates the interface in the browser,
       and executes Python and other languages' code.The notebook file is a file format with the ipynb extension that saves code, 
       images,and text in a single document,easy enough to be shared.You probably realize this, but the Intro Notebook notebook,
       is in a different browser tab, in your browser.)
    5)we have to code in the code cells(rectangular cells)
    6)Running the code: 2 ways
        a)I can go to the toolbar on top,and push the Run button.
        b)Or I can reclick on that cell,and press Shift+Enter simultaneously,it should run the same cell.
     Note that this is executing code in a Python process called the kernel, so there is a kernel running
     in the background for each open notebook or browser tab basically.The Jupyter notebook application
     talks to the kernel to have it load data and execute code.Shift Enter, or that Play button,creates 
     another cell just below the first one,while we are executing it,or while the kernel is executing it.
     So we can see that a Jupyter notebook is a collection of cells, some including code.
    7)To use the output from the one cell ==> use Underscore ==>underscore refers to the output of the last cell executed.
        (Eg: say o/p of one cell is 120 ==>in the next cell give '_/2' ==> divides 120 by 2 and gives the quotient
    8) 1e6 means 10 power 6
    9) we an copy,cut and paste the code using copy,cut and paste buttons above(click thcell which we want to copy,press the copy button
       and then click the button below which we want to paste the code and click paste button).
       To delete a cell use cut button.
       lly use + button to create a new cell(it will be created below the highlighted cell)
    10)To go to different cells(shift to modal mode)==> first press 'Escape button" then You can now use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to change cells.
        (we can do this as the notebook interface is implemented to be modal.)

3) Markdown cells:Documenting Analysis with Markdown Text
    a)create a markdown cell: first create a cell then click on the cell and change the purpose of the cell
      from cell/code to markdown by choosing markdown from the dropdown menu on the upper right corner of this notebook.
      (normally by default 'code' is selected we have to change it to 'markdown' )
    ==>Now we can write text in it instead of code and run it.This is great for documenting your data analysis pipeline.
    b)The markdown cells have support for HTML and other text formatting languages like LaTeX if you heard of that.
        For example, we can create bullet lists==> use '*' and a space,Everything I put after this bar space is rendered into a bulleted list.
        We could also create, for example, titles or headings for that we will use the hashtag symbol.
        to make text bold ==>> write b/w 2 stars i.e **text**
        to make text italics ==>> write b/w stars i.e *text*   
    c)to write an equation in LaTex,I need to write them between two dollar symbols.
        (LateX is a document editing language,which has a syntax for many text components
         for scientific writing, including writing equations.)
      ** Eg:$\int_o^\infty x^{-\alpha}$ ==> shows intgral 0 to infinity x to the power -ve alpha i.e  ∫∞ox−α
      ===> This is very handy when we are writing a scientific / white paper etc

4)Adding Images:
    I would like to show you how an image is generated inside the Notebook in a code celland how we can use markdowns 
    around it to explain that cell.
