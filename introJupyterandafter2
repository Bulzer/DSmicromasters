1)Why Jupyter?
    The data science process, in most the steps we learned about earlier in the course.Jupyter Notebooks allow us to document that process by combining notes, code, and graphics.
    Most importantly, combining these features allows others to read the notebooks and understand the motives behind each step and why decisions were made.
    If someone else wants to examine your results or build on your findings,they can see exactly how you conducted the research.
    Jupyter Notebooks don't just contain your notes and process;they contain your results as well.
    And lastly, as we mentioned before,Jupyter supports Julia, Python, R,three of the most popular programming languages for conducting data science today,along with other languages.
2)Getting started with Jupyter
    The first page is called the Dashboard.It basically lists the contents of the folder you launched Jupyter notebook from.
